# BRB_Caps
Custom 3D printable keycaps to match GMK profile. Designed for resin printing.

All caps have been printed and work, but the longer the cap, the more likely it is that it will warp. Be careful with the longer spacebars and the 60% WKL cap.

Worked great with the JLCPCB black resin, but the 12U and 15U caps are very hit or miss with warping and fitment.

I offer no warranty for issues you run into with the files and you take all risk having them made. They are offered as-is, just because I had a good result for some and bad result for others doesn't reflect your results/experience with having them printed.
